ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Thinksaber is obviously inspired by the program MacSaber, and I'm
grateful to the MacSaber people for assembling the Star Wars sound
effects collection needed to make it so successful.

Thinksaber uses a motion-detection algorithm derived from the one
written by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (miyagawa at gmail.com) for his own
thinkpad-saber program, which ran only under Perl for Windows.
Obviously, I think mine's better.

REQUIREMENTS

Thinksaber runs under PyGame, a python-based gaming library, and
should run on any IBM or Lenovo Thinkpad with PyGame installed.  Under
Linux, you may have to activate HDAPS and the joystick device.

PORTING

Thinksaber should run under Windows, but I don't have a Microsoft
Windows installation and so have no idea how to detect the
accelerometer.  Tatsuhiko Miyagawa's perl version is exclusively for
MS Windows, so in theory porting it should be possible.
