.SH REQUIREMENTS

.PP
.TP
An IBM or Lenovo Thinkpad with HDAPS 
thinksaber
only 
runs on laptops with accelerometers, which get their values through 
the HDAPS joystick emulator. 
.PP
.TP
PyGame 
thinksaber
uses the PyGame library 
(www.pygame.org), which in turn has dependencies on the Simple 
Direct Layer gaming library as well as Python. Most Linux 
distributions either come with this stock or provide it through the 
installation tool. Pygame is a dependency of a number of popular 
Linux games, so if you have any games on your system it\&'s entirely 
likely this has already been done for you. 
.PP
.TP
Make 
If you want to install the system with the distributed 
Makefile,
you need GNU\-make\&.
If you don\&'t have it, you 
should execute the steps shown in the Makefile
manually. 
.PP
.SH ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

.PP
Thinksaber
is obviously inspired by the program MacSaber, and I\&'m 
grateful to the MacSaber people for assembling the Star Wars sound 
effects collection needed to make it so successful. 
.PP
Thinksaber
uses a motion\-detection algorithm derived from the 
one written by Tatsuhiko Miyagawa (miyagawa at gmail.com) for his own 
thinkpad\-saber
program, which ran only under Perl for Windows. 
Obviously, I think mine\&'s better.
